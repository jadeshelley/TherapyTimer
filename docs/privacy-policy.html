    <h1>Privacy Policy – Therapy Timer</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the app <strong>Therapy Timer</strong> (including “Therapy Timer: Voice Control”) on Android. We do not collect, store, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing.</p>

    <h2>1. Voice / microphone</h2>
    <p>The app uses the microphone only when you enable <strong>Voice Control</strong>. Speech is processed <strong>on your device</strong> using on-device recognition. We do not send your voice or any voice data to our servers or to third parties. You can turn Voice Control off in Settings at any time.</p>

    <h2>2. Data stored on your device</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your phone (in app storage that other apps cannot access):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your routines and exercise settings</li>
        <li>App preferences (e.g. basic/custom mode, timer duration, sound and voice settings)</li>
        <li>Whether you have unlocked the Pro version (purchase state is also managed by Google Play)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data stays on your device and is not sent to us or anyone else.</p>

    <h2>3. In-app purchases (Pro)</h2>
    <p>Purchases are handled by <strong>Google Play</strong>. We do not see or store your payment details. Google’s processing is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>. We only receive from Google that a purchase was completed so the app can unlock Pro features on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Internet access</h2>
    <p>The app uses internet only for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Billing (to check and complete Pro purchases)</li>
        <li>Downloading optional text-to-speech (TTS) data if you use a network-based TTS engine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use the internet to send your personal data to our own servers.</p>

    <h2>5. No selling or sharing of personal data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing or advertising. We do not use analytics or tracking that identifies you.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or the app, contact <strong>shelleydistribution@gmail.com</strong> or open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/jadeshelley/TherapyTimer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/jadeshelley/TherapyTimer</a>.</p>
